    "## Overview\n",
    "The 2018 Kaggle Survey is a highly interesting dataset comprised of questions around many topics (e.g. tools used for Machine Learning and data analysis, industry, geography). This analysis attempts to outline patterns around gender pay gap. Not surprisingly, a considerable income discrepancy is found between genders, impacting women negatively. The analysis then moves towards questioning whether this difference in income is justified, which proves that it isn't. Women generally get a worse deal irrespective of experience and education level."

    "## Data Preparation\n",
    "For this analysis, some of the data points have been manipulated respective to the original dataset. These are:\n",
    "- **Gender**: only the samples where the person who filled the survey declared being either a man or a woman have been kept.\n",
    "- **Range data**: answers on dimensions such as income, age or experience (e.g. in current role, coding) come mostly in two flavours: 1) as ranges (e.g. 30-34 years), in these cases an average was made between the two (e.g. 32 years); and 2) as a number with a \"+\" sign meaning *more than* (e.g. $500,000+), in these cases just the number was kept (e.g. 500,000).\n",
    "- When considered appropriate, data has been deliberately left out in certain visualizations with the aim of better represent the reality. For instance, when showing *average income by age*, only data points that represented 50 or more respondents were included."
